# Traffic And Mobility Research Notes

This note tracks the traffic-rule pass for RealCity.

## Sources Reviewed

- Eclipse SUMO traffic lights:
  https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Simulation/Traffic_Lights.html
  - Adopted: static `tlLogic`-style phase sequence, explicit yellow phases, and
    optional all-red clearance before the next green phase.
  - Adopted: signal states as whole-intersection phases, not isolated lamp
    toggles.
- Eclipse SUMO pedestrians:
  https://eclipse.dev/sumo/docs/Simulation/Pedestrians.html
  - Adopted: sidewalks, walking areas, and crossings are distinct routing
    surfaces; pedestrians should not treat the drive lane as normal walking
    space.
  - Adopted: a crossing should be considered unavailable when vehicles block
    the crossing path.
- MobilityData GBFS:
  https://gbfs.org/specification
  - Adopted as future data-model shape for shared micromobility: station or
    vehicle status should be near-realtime and separated from static system
    metadata.
- smart-data-models/SmartCities:
  https://github.com/smart-data-models/SmartCities
  - Adopted as a model direction: traffic, parking, building, and mobility rules
    should be represented as explicit city data, not hidden constants.
- qiliuchn/GATSim:
  https://github.com/qiliuchn/gatsim
  - Adopted: traffic agents should perceive traffic conditions, remember
    experiences, adapt schedules, re-route, and combine human-like decisions
    with transport simulation state.

## RealCity Application

- Vehicle signals now use a SUMO-inspired static cycle:
  - X-axis protected green
  - X-axis yellow clearance
  - all-red clearance
  - Z-axis protected green
  - Z-axis yellow clearance
  - all-red clearance
- Vehicles stop against stop bars, not the center of the intersection.
- Yellow means far vehicles decelerate, while close vehicles clear the
  intersection.
- All-red is treated as clearance; vehicles stop and pedestrians do not start a
  new crossing.
- Pedestrian WALK now requires a protected phase: the crossed vehicle axis must
  be red while the orthogonal vehicle axis has protected green.
- Runtime metadata exposes phase names, SUMO-like four-character states, stop
  rules, vehicle stop-bar samples, and pedestrian signal coupling for automated
  verification.

## Next Traffic Targets

- Add explicit turn lanes and turn intentions.
- Add queue length and detector-like pressure so green splits can become
  actuated in high-traffic areas.
- Add GBFS-like bike/scooter stations and geofenced no-ride/no-parking zones.
- Add parking/loading rules from Smart Data Models and route taxis/deliveries
  through legal curb zones.
- Add GATSim-like mobility disruption events that make NPCs delay, re-route, or
  change mode.
